My research focuses on economic development, including strategies of improving agriculture productivity; food security and nutrition; improved seed adoption impacts; strategies for transforming Malawi's food systems; social cash transfer welfare impacts; impacts of control of goods act under the control of goods act (COGA) in Malawi. 

I have a Masters Degree in Agriculture and Applied Economics obtained from [Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources](https://luanar.ac.mw/luanar/) (LUANAR) and [University of Pretoria](https://www.up.ac.za/).
