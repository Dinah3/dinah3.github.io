I am a Policy researcher at [MwAPATA Institute](https://www.mwapata.mw/about) in Malawi. My research focuses on economic development, including strategies of improving agriculture productivity; food security and nutrition; improved seed adoption impacts; strategies for transforming Malawi's food systems; social cash transfer welfare impacts; impacts of control of goods act under the control of goods act (COGA) in Malawi. 

I have a Masters Degree in Agriculture and Applied Economics obtained from [LUANAR](https://luanar.ac.mw/luanar/) and [University of Pretoria](https://www.up.ac.za/). Currently, I am studying PhD in Agriculture and Resource Economics from the same [LUANAR](https://luanar.ac.mw/luanar/), and I am a Research fellow of [CEGA](https://cega.berkeley.edu/) and [PEP](https://www.pep-net.org/) at [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), USA.
